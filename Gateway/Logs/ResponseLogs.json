In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Th\u00E9nardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Mis\u00E9rables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope\u2014an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.","rating":4.18,"releaseDate":"1987-03-03T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["classics","fiction","historical fiction","literature","france","historical","novels","french literature","romance","classic literature"],"isbn":"9537672423884","author":"Victor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock (Translator), Norman MacAfee (Translator)","publisher":"Signet","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","name":"Southgate Community Library","address":{"street":"27 Market Square","town":"London","postcode":"N14 6DN"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9c5","status":"Available","branch":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfbe27bd6488d0ab1b4","title":"lord of the flies","language":"English","description":"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger\u0027s classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time\u0027s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950\u0027s and 60\u0027s it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","rating":3.81,"releaseDate":"2001-01-30T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["classics","fiction","young adult","literature","school","novels","coming of age","american","high school","read for school"],"isbn":"9780316769174","author":"J.D.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Th\u00E9nardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

Although Holmes gained a reputation for infallibility, Conan Doyle showed his own realism and feminism by having the great detective defeated by Irene Adler - the woman - in the very first story, \u0027A Scandal in Bohemia\u0027.

Alice Walker\u0027s iconic modern classic is now a Penguin Book.A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence. Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie, Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. The Color Purple broke the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Th\u00E9nardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine.

In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Th\u00E9nardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Mis\u00E9rables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope\u2014an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.","rating":4.18,"releaseDate":"1987-03-03T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["classics","fiction","historical fiction","literature","france","historical","novels","french literature","romance","classic literature"],"isbn":"9537672423884","author":"Victor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock (Translator), Norman MacAfee (Translator)","publisher":"Signet","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","name":"Southgate Community Library","address":{"street":"27 Market Square","town":"London","postcode":"N14 6DN"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9c5","status":"Available","branch":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfbe27bd6488d0ab1b4","title":"lord of the flies","language":"English","description":"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

Frank lives for his father\u0027s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank\u0027s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig\u0027s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. Angela\u0027s Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt\u0027s astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","rating":4.11,"releaseDate":"2005-10-03T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["nonfiction","memoir","biography","classics","ireland","autobiography","biography memoir","history","irish literature","historical"],"isbn":"9780007205233","author":"Frank McCourt","publisher":"Harper","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","name":"Southgate Community Library","address":{"street":"27 Market Square","town":"London","postcode":"N14 6DN"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4faa01","status":"Available","branch":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfde27bd6488d0ab1f5","title":"vampire academy","language":"English","description":"ONLY A TRUE BEST FRIEND CAN PROTECT YOU FROM YOUR IMMORTAL ENEMIES...Lissa Dragomir is a Moroi princess: a mortal vampire with a rare gift for harnessing the earth\u0027s magic.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.","rating":4.07,"releaseDate":"1994-10-28T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["nonfiction","classics","true crime","crime","mystery","history","literature","thriller","american","biography"],"isbn":"9780679745587","author":"Truman Capote","publisher":"Vintage","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","name":"Elm Park Library","address":{"street":"15 Elm Street","town":"Birmingham","postcode":"B3 2AX"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4faa36","status":"Available","branch":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfde27bd6488d0ab21f","title":"fight club","language":"English","description":"Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation\u2019s most visionary satirist in this, his first book.

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.","rating":4.07,"releaseDate":"1994-10-28T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["nonfiction","classics","true crime","crime","mystery","history","literature","thriller","american","biography"],"isbn":"9780679745587","author":"Truman Capote","publisher":"Vintage","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","name":"Elm Park Library","address":{"street":"15 Elm Street","town":"Birmingham","postcode":"B3 2AX"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4faa36","status":"Available","branch":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfde27bd6488d0ab21f","title":"fight club","language":"English","description":"Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation\u2019s most visionary satirist in this, his first book.

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family\u2014Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma\u2019s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa\u2019s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing\u2014his very own horse\u2014but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. With snow piled as high as the rooftops, it\u2019s impossible for trains to deliver supplies, and the townspeople, including Laura and her family, are starving. Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and \u201Cliteraries,\u201D work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It\u2019s not easy, and for the first time she\u2019s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married!

The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet.

But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It\u2019s not easy, and for the first time she\u2019s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.","rating":4.07,"releaseDate":"1994-10-28T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["nonfiction","classics","true crime","crime","mystery","history","literature","thriller","american","biography"],"isbn":"9780679745587","author":"Truman Capote","publisher":"Vintage","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","name":"Elm Park Library","address":{"street":"15 Elm Street","town":"Birmingham","postcode":"B3 2AX"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4faa36","status":"Available","branch":"6733491ba1ed2d02eef46a42","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfde27bd6488d0ab21f","title":"fight club","language":"English","description":"Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation\u2019s most visionary satirist in this, his first book.

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters\u0027 futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers\u0027 advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives \u2013 until their own inner crises reveal how much they\u0027ve unknowingly inherited of their mothers\u0027 pasts. With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.","rating":3.93,"releaseDate":"2006-09-21T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["fiction","historical fiction","classics","china","contemporary","adult fiction","adult","literature","asia","novels"],"isbn":"9780143038092","author":"Amy Tan (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"Penguin","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","name":"Elm Park Library","address":{"street":"15 Elm Street","town":"Birmingham","postcode":"B3 2AX"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4faa63","status":"Available","branch":"67236fc4b4d08aab049740ca","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfee27bd6488d0ab24f","title":"alice in wonderland","language":"English","description":"\n  This is an adaptation.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","rating":4.31,"releaseDate":"2002-02-04T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["historical fiction","fiction","historical","fantasy","classics","medieval","audiobook","british literature","novels","adult"],"isbn":"1165667010651","author":"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author)","publisher":"NAL","director":"","studio":"","creator":"","network":"","season":0,"episodes":0,"endDate":null,"physicalCopies":[]},"branchDetails":{"objectId":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","name":"Hillside Public Library","address":{"street":"14 Grove Avenue","town":"Manchester","postcode":"M2 5JD"}},"reservations":[]},{"objectId":"673f6d28e580ac7f9f4fa9eb","status":"Available","branch":"673348f4a1ed2d02eef46a41","mediaInfo":{"objectId":"673f6cfce27bd6488d0ab1df","title":"the stand","language":"English","description":"This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.

But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author\u0027s lifelong meditation on America.

As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

The text is accompanied by entirely new explanatory annotations.New to the fourth Edition are twelve of Emily Bronte\u0027s letters regarding the publication of the 1847 edition of Wuthering Heights as well as the evolution of the 1850 edition, prose and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and Edward Chitham\u0027s insightful and informative chronology of the creative process behind the beloved work.Five major critical interpretations of Wuthering Heights are included, three of them new to the Fourth Edition. A Stuart Daley considers the importance of chronology in the novel. J. Hillis Miller examines Wuthering Heights\u0027s problems of genre and critical reputation. Sandra M.

In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Th\u00E9nardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.Illustration: Jim Tierney","rating":3.88,"releaseDate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00Z","type":"Book","genres":["fiction","classics","fantasy","philosophy","novels","spirituality","literature","self help","inspirational","adventure"],"isbn":"9780062315007","author":"Paulo Coelho (Goodreads Author), Alan R.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \u0022social\u0022) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\u0027s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\u0027s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.
